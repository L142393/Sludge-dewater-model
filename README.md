# Sludge Dewatering Prediction Tool

This project is a Flask-based web application for predicting the efficiency or outcome of sludge dewatering using machine learning models (XGBoost). The application provides a bilingual (English/Chinese) user interface and supports input of key process parameters to generate real-time predictions.

## Features

- GUI-based web interface (local deployment)
- Bilingual support (中文 / English)
- Uses a pre-trained XGBoost model
- Real-time prediction based on user input
- Encoded categorical features (catalyst, radical donor)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if using `.ipynb` for development)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the code files.
2. Install required packages:
